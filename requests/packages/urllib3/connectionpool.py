            Automatically handle redirects (status codes 301, 302, 303, 307),
            each redirect counts as a retry.

            If set and the pool is set to block=True, then this method will
            block for ``pool_timeout`` seconds and raise EmptyPoolError if no
            connection is available within the time period.
