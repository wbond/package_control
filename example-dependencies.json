	// This file is a filesystem-level solution for specifying libraries
	// for packages. This is most useful for package developers since they are
	// not installing their own packages from a repository or channel, and
	// need to make sure Package Control installs the libraries they need.

	// The file contains two levels of selectors, platform and Sublime Text
	// version, to pick what set of libraries should be installed.
	// The most-specific selectors will be used, and all other ignored. This
	// means that some libraries will be duplicated under a specific
	// platform and under *.

	// The first level of keys should be the value from sublime.platform(),
	// or "*" for all platforms.
	"windows": {

		// The second level should be a version selector, like used for
		// the sublime_text value in package releases.
		"<3000": [
			"select-windows",
			"cffi",
			"cryptography",
			"pyOpenSSL"
		]
	},

	// Matching of platform and version selectors is exclusive. Thus, these
	// libraries will only be installed if no other keys matched first.
	"*": {
		"*": [
			"cffi",
			"cryptography",
			"pyOpenSSL"
		]
	}
