	// Package Control ships with the SSL Certificate Authority (CA) cert for the

	// for the various URLs that Package Control need to connect to. This way the
	// default channel (https://sublime.wbond.net/channel.json) can provide
	// real-time updates to CA certs in the case that a CA is compromised. The
	// CA certs are extracted from openssl, and the server runs on an LTS version
	// of Ubuntu, which automatically applies security patches from the official
	// Ubuntu repositories. This architecture helps to ensure that the packages
	// being downloaded are from the source listed and that users are very
