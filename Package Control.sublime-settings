	// is automatically used via WinINet.
	//
	// If a custom cert is required for a proxy or for an alternate channel
	// or repository domain name, it should be added in one of the two forms:
	//
	// "*": ["my_identifier", "https://example.com/url/of/cert_file"]
	// "*": ["my_identifier_2", "/absolute/filesystem/path/to/cert_file"]
	//
	// In both cases the literal "*" means the cert will be checked to ensure
	// it is present for accessing any URL. This is necessary for proxy
	// connections, but also useful if you want to provide you own
	// Pckage Control.ca-bundle file.
	//
	// The "my_identifier" and "my_identifier_2" can be any unique string
	// that Package Control can use as a filename, and ensures that it has
	// merged the cert file with the ca-bundle.crt file in the certs/ directory
	// since that is what is passed to the downloaders.
